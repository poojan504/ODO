An old silent pond...,A frog jumps into the pond,splash! Silence again
Autumn moonlight,a worm digs,silently into the chestnut
In the twilight,rainthese brilliant-hued hibiscus,A lovely sunset
A summer river,being crossedhow pleasing,with sandals in my hands!
Light of the moon Moves west,flowers' shadows,creep eastward
In the moonlight,the color and scent of the wisteria,seems far away
O snail,climb Mount Fuji,but slowly, slowly!
Trusting the Buddha,good and bad,I bid farewell to the departing year
Everything I touch,with tenderness,alas pricks like a bramble
The lamp once outCool,stars enter,the window frame
Plum flower temple,Voices rise,from the foothills
The crow has flown away,swaying in the evening sun,a leafless tree
